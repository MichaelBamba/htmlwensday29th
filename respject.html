        <h1>Boredom leads me back to Pokemon</h1>
       <p> Mega Blastoise is one of RU's best spinners, giving it an important 
        place on many offensive and balanced teams. Its high Special Attack 
        and excellent Mega Launcher-boosted coverage make it a pain for offensive 
        teams to switch into, and between the switches its prowess forces and the passive walls that teams often use to check it, it finds many opportunities to spin. Having Dark Pulse to keep Ghost-types from safely spinblocking and outspeeding common coverage-weak Stealth Rock setters in Bronzong, Nidoqueen, and Rhyperior make its job even easier. Its good natural bulk enables it to take at least one strong neutral hit to deal massive damage back or do one last spin. Mega Blastoise's greatest flaw is its complete lack of recovery; this issue combined with its susceptibility to all forms of entry hazards and status leads to it inevitably getting worn down. Its average Speed tier renders it easy to offensively pressure, especially since switching in to spin several times will put it in KO range of many faster attackers. 
        It faces a lot of competition from Donphan as a spinner and from the 
        likes of Golisopod, Araquanid, and Slowbro as a Water-type with 
        unique utility.</p>
